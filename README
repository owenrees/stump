This is a clone of one of the versions of stump/webstump as used in the uk.*
hierarchy.

License: GPL v2 - see stump/LICENSE and webstump/LICENSE

This code is probably based on v2.0 of stump/webstump but has been extensively
modified since then.

This repository was set up in response to a discussion in uk.net.news.moderation
about issues with the modbot. It is primarily a place for those who run the
systems in the uk.* hierarchy to review and adopt or adapt proposed changes.

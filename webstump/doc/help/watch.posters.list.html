Untrusted posters list is the list of email addresses (no names) of
posters whose posts should always be reviewed by mods, even if they are
posting to a preapproved thread.<P>

Example:<P>

<PRE>
anonymous
nobody
remailer
mixmaster
losingtemper@aol.com
</PRE>

The above would ensure that all addresses containing substrings above
would always come to human attention. A nice way to deal with anon
remailers.

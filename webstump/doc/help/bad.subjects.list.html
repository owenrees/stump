Banned subects list is the list of fragments of Subject: fields or whole
Subject: fields you would like to permanently bar from your newsgroup. It
can be a list like this<P>

<PRE>
Gun control
Abortion
</PRE>

That means that no message containing (in Subject:) words "gun control"
or "abortion" would ever be posted.<P>

Of course, populating this list is a matter of your policy. However, I
want to warn new moderators that banning subjects would also have
the effect of preventing meta-discussions. For instance, someone
suggesting that Abortion should now be discussed would not be able to
post this suggestion.

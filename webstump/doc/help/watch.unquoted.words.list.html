<p>List of words to watch is the list of text patterns 
which, if they appear in a message, should ensure that the message is
not automatically approved and is stored in WebSTUMP for human review
unless they appear in text quoted from a previously approved posting</p>

<p>These words may be an indication of a potential spam, or a flame
etc. Perhaps, for many groups, putting common profanities, as well
as things like XXX and 1-900, is a good strategy. Note however, that
there is generally no reason to forbid the use of profanity, as such.</p>>

<p>Example:</p>>

<PRE>
bonehead
dickhead
</PRE>

<p>My advice is to watch your group for patterns appearing in offtopic posts,
and use them to your advantage to help you with filtering.</p>

WebSTUMP has a capability to process certain articles automatically,
without involving a human moderator. For instance, if you decide that a
certain thread has strayed off topic, and you no longer want ANY articles
from that thread to ever appear, you can add the Subject of that thread
to the list of bad threads. That will cause all submissions with that
subject header to be automatically rejected.<P>

Generally, WebSTUMP users can do filtering by the following criteria:

<UL>
  <LI> By poster
  <LI> By Subject
  <LI> use the list of suspicious words
</UL>

The algorithm for every incoming article is as follows:

<OL>

  <LI> Reject message if the author is listed in <A
       HREF=##bad.posters.list>the List of Banned Posters.</A>.

  <LI> Reject message if the Subject: field is listed in <A
       HREF=##bad.subjects.list>the List of Banned Subjects</A>.

  <LI> Reject message if the article contains words from <A
       HREF=##bad.words.list>the List of Banned Words</A>.

  <LI> File message for human review if the author is listed in <A
       HREF=##watch.posters.list>the List of Untrusted Posters</A>.

  <LI> File message for human review if the article contains words from <A

Bad posters list is the list of email addresses (no names) of posters who
you would like to permanently bar from your newsgroup. It can be a list like
this<P>

<PRE>
spammer@savetrees.com
troll@aol.com
</PRE>

Of course, populating this list is a matter of your policy. however, I
want to warn new moderators that blacklisting is a controversial practice,
and if it is ever to be used, it should be used for a really good reason.

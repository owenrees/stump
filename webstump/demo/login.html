  Please log into misc.invest.financial-plan. You can only log in if
  you know your login id and know the secret password. You should not
  give your password to any unauthorized user. Your login id and
  password are NOT case sentitive, which means that, for example,
  "xyzzy" and "XyZZY" are equally valid.<P>

  Log in as "admin" if you want to add/delete users or change their
  passwords. <P>

  First Time Users: You have to log in as admin and add a moderator user
  who will be able to moderate the newsgroup. Then log in again as that
  user. If you are a new user, you have to have your admin password assigned to
  you by the administrator. If you are a former user of a previous version of
  WebSTUMP, type "admin" in the username prompt and your old "secret word"
  as the admin password.<P>

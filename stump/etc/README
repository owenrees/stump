			STUMP Configuration Directory

This directory contains files that the supporter of the robomoderator
for your newsgroup (you) is supposed to edit to reflect the
details of your newsgroup. You will have to edit most of the files
under this directory to set such parameters as your newsgroup
name, maximum number of crossposts, specify email addresses of
your human moderators, and so on.

Below is a short summary of what files you should edit and what they
are for. Refer to comments in individual files for more details on
how you should modify them.

I suggest editing the files in the order they are listed here. It 
is more logical.

==================================================> added-headers

Edit this file and put the header lines that you want to see appended
to all approved articles. Put there something to the effect that you
are not responsible for contents of approved posts, put your
submission and complaint addresses, and if possible provide an
URL of the Web page with your FAQ and Charter.

==================================================> approval.key.txt

To set this file, you MUST have already created your PGP keys
needed for moderation. Please refer to the online documentation
explaining what keys to create and how to do it. Here's how
to extract the key AFTER you have created it: 

pgp -kxaf csfm-approval-key > $HOME/stump/etc/approval.key.txt

==================================================> rejection-reasons.lst

This file should list exactly the same reasons as mentioned
in "reject" perl script, BUT in a different format

reason::textual explanation of the reason.

This file is used by the ModScape subsystem.

==================================================> conforms_charter

This shell script allows you to define newsgroup-specific
checks for submissions. If conforms_charter returns a non-zero
exit code, the submission will be rejected automatically.
soc.culture.russian.moderated uses this script to reject
all binary files.

==================================================> crontab

This file specifies which programs should be run at regular intervals.
You can skip it if you just started setting up STUMP.

==================================================> messages

This DIRECTORY contains explanations for various reasons for rejection.
Refer to "reject" script for details on rejection reasons, names and
files.

==================================================> modack.approved

This shell script is used to send acknowledgments to posters whose messages
get approved by the robomoderator. Edit this script so that the
text message is specific to your newsgroups.

==================================================> modack.received

This shell script is used to send acknowledgments to posters whose
messages were received by the robomoderator. Edit this script so that
the text message is specific to your newsgroups.

==================================================> modenv

This is the main configuration file for your newsgroup. It has extensive
instructions. Edit it very carefully and make sure that PATH includes all
common directories.

==================================================> moderators

This file lists all human moderators and member of moderator
board for your newsgroup, along with some flags. Please refer to 
the file itself for more details.

Besides initial setup, you will need to edit this file to support
moderators going to vacations.

==================================================> mods-message

This shell script is responsible for sending messages for your
moderator board to the members of said board. You do not really
need to edit it.

==================================================> mods.sig

Signature for the moderators-only mailing list. It is appended at the
bottom of every message that is distributed to human moderators.
Edit it and put whatever you want there.

==================================================> posted_log

This little shell script created a posted log file
in your home directory. Ignore it.

==================================================> procmail

This DIRECTORY contains some procmail rc files for archiving
messages. You only need to edit them if you have procmail and
formail in some non-standard place.

==================================================> procmailrc

This file defines rules for processing incoming mail. You will
need to edit it extensively if your group relies on different 
system of aliases than those that I recommend (a bad idea!).

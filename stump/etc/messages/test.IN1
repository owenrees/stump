Thank you for your message.  It successfully reached the moderators
and if it had been approved it would have been posted and should have
propagated properly.

However, we do not like to approve test postings because they are
irritating to read and can drown out discussion in the newsgroup.
So your message has been rejected and will not be posted.

This isn't anything personal and we'll be happy to approve a message
from you with appropriate on-topic content.

Please refer to the group charter and moderation policy at
  %GROUPURL%
and direct your queries to
  %MODEMAIL%

If you have difficulty reaching the moderators (eg due to
spamfiltering) please tell %SPAMFILTERINGADMIN%.

Thank you,
	- Moderator.
